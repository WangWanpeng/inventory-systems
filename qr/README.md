Several implementations to compute costs for a single item inventory
system under the Q,r ordering policy.


- Federgruen and Zheng's model to compute optimal values for Q,r

- Hadley and Whitin

- Factory Physics formulas (in a Pweave file)

- qr_comments contains comments in latex (easier to edit)

- qr_simulation speaks for itself
